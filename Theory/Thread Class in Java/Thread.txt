Thread is a independent sequential path of execution within a program.

Many threads can run concurrently withing  a program.

At runtime, threads in a program exist in a common memory space and can, therefore share both data and 
code,( i.e they are lightweight compared to processes).

They also share the process running the program.

3 Important concept related to multithreading in Java:

1. Creating threads and providing the code that gets executed by a thread.
2. Accessing common data and code through synchronisation.
3. Transitioning between thread states.
