Lets say there is a queue. And there are different types of threads. Let me divide the threads into two groups.
One group of thread is trying to push item in the the queue, Other group of thread is trying to
remove items from the queue.

So we can only push items, 
We can only push item in the queue, if queue doesnot go out of capacity.
We can only pop item from the queue, if there is any item.

In multithreading environment, multiple item might be trying to pull out of the queue, and multiple thread might be trying to push in the queue.

Make a class Blocking queue.
